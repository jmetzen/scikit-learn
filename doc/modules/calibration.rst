Probability calibration
=======================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.calibration


When performing classification you often want not only to predict the class
label, but also obtain a probability of the respective label.  This probability
gives you some kind of confidence on the prediction.  Some models can give you
poor estimates of the class probabilities and some even do not not support
probability prediction. The calibration module allows you to better calibrate
the probabilities of a given model, or to add support for probability
prediction.

Well calibrated classifiers are probabilistic classifiers for which the output
of the predict_proba method can be directly interpreted as a confidence level.
For instance a well calibrated (binary) classifier should classify the samples
such that among the samples to which it gave a predict_proba value close to 0.8,
approx. 80% actually belong to the positive class. The following plot compares
how well the probabilistic predictions of different classifiers are calibrated:

:class:`LogisticRegression` returns well calibrated predictions as it directly
optimizes log-loss. In contrast, the other methods return biased probilities;
with different biases per method:

 * :class:`GaussianNaiveBayes` tends to push probabilties to 0 or 1 (note the counts in the histograms). This is mainly because it makes the assumption that  features are conditionally independent given the class, which is not the case in  this dataset which contains 2 redundant features.

 * :class:`RandomForestClassifier` shows the opposite behavior: the histograms show peaks at approx. 0.2 and 0.9 probability, while probabilities close to 0 or 1 are very rare. An explanation for this is given by Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana [4]: "Methods such as bagging and random forests that average predictions from a base set of models can have difficulty making predictions near 0 and 1 because variance in the underlying base models will bias predictions that should be near zero or one away from these values. Because predictions are restricted to the interval [0,1], errors caused by variance tend to be one-sided near zero and one. For example, if a model should predict p = 0 for a case, the only way bagging can achieve this is if all bagged trees predict zero. If we add noise to the trees that bagging is averaging over, this noise will cause some trees to predict values larger than 0 for this case, thus moving the average prediction of the bagged ensemble away from 0. We observe this effect most strongly with random forests because the base-level trees trained with random forests have relatively high variance due to feature subseting." As a result, the calibration curve shows a characteristic sigmoid shape, indicating that the classifier could trust its "intuition" more and return probabilties closer to 0 or 1 typically.

 * Support Vector Classification (:class:`SVC`) shows a similar sigmoid curve as  the  RandomForestClassifier, which is typical for maximum-margin methods (compare Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana [4]).

Two approaches for performing calibration of probabilistic predictions are
provided: a parametric approach based on Platt's sigmoid model and a  non-
parametric approach based on isotonic regression :mod:`sklearn.isotonic`.
Probability calibration should be done on new data not used for model fitting.
The class :class:`CalibratedClassifierCV` uses a cross-validation generator and
estimates for each split the model parameter on the train samples and the
calibration of the test samples. The probabilities predicted obtained for each
folds are then averaged. Already fitted classifiers can be calibrated by
:class:`CalibratedClassifierCV` via the paramter cv="prefit". In this case,
the user has to take care manually that data for model fitting and calibration
is disjoint.

The following images demonstrate the benefit of probability calibration.
The first image present a dataset with 2 classes and 3 blobs of
data. The blob in the middle contains random samples of each class.
The probability for the samples in this blob should be 0.5.

The following image shows on the data above the estimated probability
using a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier without calibration,
with a sigmoid calibration and with a non-parametric isotonic
calibration. One can observe that the non-parametric model
provides the most accurate probability estimates for samples
in the middle, i.e., 0.5.

The last image shows with the covertype dataset the estimated probabilities
obtained with :class:`LogisticRegression`, :class:`GaussianNB`,
:class:`GaussianNB` with both isotonic calibration and sigmoid calibration. The
calibration performance is evaluated with Brier score
:func:`metrics.brier_score_loss`, reported in the legend (the smaller the
better). One can observe here that logistic regression is well calibrated and
that isotonic calibration greatly improves over uncalibrated
:class:`GaussianNB`.

The following calibration plots were made with
:func:`calibration.plot_calibration_curve`.
